 I"d like to put together a good description on how to do this but I"ll
 need how to set up the DEVICE File under GT.M.
 
 Here are the TWO field and their values for DSM and CACHE.  What would
 be the equivalent value for GT.M? 
 
 DSM      $I: 6010
 CACHE    $I: |TCP|6010
 
 DSM      OPEN PARAMETERS: (TCPCHAN:ADDRESS="10.179.25.170")
 CACHE    OPEN PARAMETERS: ("10.179.25.170":6010:"s"::512:512)
 
 
 In the meantime try these changes
 
 1. Each instrument has its interface routine usually LATPORTnn
 
 After the USE command add these
 
 X ^%ZOSF("TYPE-AHEAD"),^%ZOSF("LABOFF")
 
 Add these to the DEVICE FILE entry for the instrument. You can
 experiment with the OPEN TIMEOUT VALUE.
 
 Select DEVICE NAME: LAB STA 1 DIRCONN      41/BA-115     LTA41037
 USE TIMEOUT ON OPENS: YES//
 OPEN TIMEOUT: 5//

 Subject: [Hardhats-members] Question converting DI Lab Instrument
 Manager from serial to tcp/ip
 
 Hello,
  
  We have a Data Innovations Instrument Manager interfaced to VISTA via a
 serial line (uses routine HLLP).  This setup has worked great for years
 until recently. It appears some noise has been introduced into the
 serial line between the Instrument Manager PC and the Terminal Server;
 the messages for a particular instrument are rejected "sometimes" due to
 checksum errors at the VISTA end.  Troubleshooting serial lines is a
 PITA, so...
 
 I"m interested in taking the serial line out of the loop.   Does anyone 
 out there
 have the complete instructions for converting the DI Instrument Manager
 to 
 
 tcp/ip?  A technician at Data Innovations mentioned routine HLZTCP, ???
 
 
 Thanks in advance,
 Charles
