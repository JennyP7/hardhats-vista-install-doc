<p>To send messages to Q-PATCH.OSEHRA.ORG from your own VISTA system, you can send it via the internet by setting up postfix and having it do the work for you (as above). An easier alternative is to configure a direct link, as follows: (NB: This example is only for GT.M. Use the Cache Mailman Conduits for Cache.) To send HFS checksum messages (for packages exported via HFS) you need to create FORUM.OSEHRA.ORG.</p>

<p>Next, a domain should be set up for the VistA instance. A domain name is typically used to uniquely identify an instance on a network. While this is not necessary to do for test instances, it is recommended that a new domain be added. The OSEHRA script adds a domain called <code>DEMO.OSEHRA.ORG</code>, and this example will do the same.</p>
<p>First we add the entry to the <code>DOMAIN</code> file through FileMan.</p>

<h2 id="set-box-volume-pair">Set Box-Volume pair</h2>
<p>The first step is to find the box volume pair for the local machine.</p>
<code>> <strong>D GETENV^%ZOSV W Y</strong></code>
<p>which will print out a message with four parts separated by <code>^</code> that could look something like:</p>
<code>VISTA^VISTA^palaven^VISTA:CACHE</code>
<p>The four pieces of the string are:</p>
<p><code>UCI^VOL^NODE^VOLUME:BOX</code></p>
<p>The fourth piece, the VOLUME:BOX pair, is referred to as the &quot;BOX VOLUME pair&quot;. The first component of the Box Volume pair is the Volume Set, which is used to determine where the VistA system will be able to find the routines. The second component Box, which references the system that the instance is on. In a Caché system, it would be the name of the Caché instance while on GT.M, it should reference the hostname of the machine.</p>
<p>The Volume Set result needs to be altered in the <code>VOLUME SET</code> file, and we will reuse some setup by writing over the name of the first entry that is already in the VistA system. The first entry, the entry with an IEN of 1, can be selected by entering <code>`1</code>.</p>
<p>Then we rename the first Box-Volume pair in the <code>TaskMan Site Parameters</code> file to match what was found above.</p>
<p>For this demonstration instance, the Volume Set will be <code>VISTA</code> which is the Caché namespace that holds the files. On GT.M instances, the default value of <code>PLA</code> can be maintained.</p>

<p>The answer to these questions is dependent on the MUMPS platform that is in use:</p>
<h3 id="on-caché">On Caché</h3>
<p>Caché systems can use the Listener Starter to control the RPC Broker Listener.</p>
<code>  STATUS: STOPPED// <strong>1</strong> START

<h3 id="on-gt.m">On GT.M</h3>

<li>CPRS Tab Access</li>
<li>An ACCESS CODE</li>

<p>The menu option ensures that the user has the proper permissions to access CPRS after signing in with their ACCESS and VERIFY codes. The Tab access can limit the amount of things a user can access once they have signed in.</p>
<p>The adding of the user is done through the User Management menu in the menu system, which will ask for information in a series of prompts then will open a Screenman form to complete the task.</p>

<p>Now you will be presented with a screen with multiple options. You can navigate the screen with the TAB key. For navigation help, use your keyboard arrows to move down to the command line and hold down either the Num Lock key (which is mapped as PF1 of a VT-320 terminal by Caché) or F1 for other terminal emulations and hit &quot;H&quot; and then Enter for help. You can exit by typing &quot;^&quot; on the command line and the change you made will be saved. As a minimum, assign EVE as the PRIMARY MENU and enter IRM (it's the only choice) as SERVICE/SECTION. If you plan to use CPRS, enter OR CPRS GUI CHART as a SECONDARY MENU OPTION. Enter other data as you deem appropriate.</p>

<p>Type &quot;N&quot;EXT PAGE at COMMAND: to go to page 2 to update the TIMED READ field and other fields you wish to update. For DEFAULT TIMED-READ (SECONDS): if you change it to 3600 you will be allow an hour before being automatically signed off. It makes it easier to work when you are learning and setting things up.</p>
<p>Press &lt;PF1&gt; refers to notations for use of Vista on Terminals. For example, the original VT-320 keyboard had additional character sets and keys which include Find, Select, Insert, Remove, Previous Screen, Next Screen, an arrow cluster and F1 to F20. With Caché, the Keys are &quot;mapped&quot;, which means when you push a given key it acts as the key would in a terminal. For instance, F1, F2, F3 and F4 are equivalent to the PF1, PF2, PF3 and PF4 keys on the terminal keyboard and Page Up and Page Down on the computer keyboard correspond to Previous Screen and Next Screen. A listing of other mappings can be found at the Caché Cube Terminal window under Help and search Keyboard Mappings. Also there is lots of information about terminal if you are interested at www.VT100.net.</p>

<p>Update the Devices, Start Taskman and Mail a Message</p>
<p>These are basic devices to complete the setup. You can setup other devices, such as printers, later.</p>
<p>97.</p>
<p>Now to update devices. The Platinum CACHE.DAT already comes with preconfigured devices. It is best to leave the VOLUME SET(CPU) field blank. The help text for the field states: &quot;If no name has been entered for this field, this device is assumed to be accessible from all CPUs in the network. In other words, when this device is referenced, the device handler will operate as if this device is resident on the local CPU&quot;. The SIGN-ON/SYSTEM DEVICE: field should be set to NO or left blank for output devices and YES if the device is used to log on to the system. Use FileMan to edit the CONSOLE, NULL, HFS, and TELNET devices. CONSOLE is the primary logon device. The NULL device is used by the Vista RPC Broker and HFS is used by the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) to install application patches and new applications when they are released. On the single user Caché PC you will not need the TELNET device since it does not allow remote access. At the &gt; prompt, type &quot;D Q^DI&quot; to invoke VA Fileman. At Select OPTION: type &quot;1&quot; (ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES) and at INPUT TO WHAT FILE:, enter &quot;3.5&quot;.</p>

<p>Screen #1</p>
<p>pic 29 - Check TaskMan Environment2</p>
<p>Screen #2</p>

<p>If TaskMan's environment is OK, you are ready to start TaskMan. Go back to the VISTA prompt and type &quot;D ^ZTMB&quot; to start TASKMAN.</p>
<p>100.</p>
<p>To monitor TaskMan, enter &quot;D ^ZTMON&quot; from the VISTA prompt. Enter &quot;^&quot; at the UPDATE// prompt to exit the monitor or enter a &quot;?&quot; to see what the other options are.</p>
<p>pic 30 - Monitor TaskMan</p>
<p>101.</p>
<p>From the &gt; programmer prompt you can check the system status with &quot;D ^%SS&quot;. You should see at least two Taskman processes - %ZTM and %ZTMS.</p>
<p>pic 31 - System Status with TM</p>
<p>102.</p>
<p>Now send a message using Postmaster to your DUZ number. Use D ^%CD to get into the namespace, VISTA, and then type &quot;S DUZ=.5 D ^XUP&quot;. You will get the response SETTING UP PROGRAMMER ENVIROMENT then TERMINAL TYPE SET TO: (your default) and Select OPTION NAME:. You will need to respond: &quot;XMUSER&quot;. At Select Mailman Menu Option: type &quot;S&quot; (for send). At Subject: enter your subject, such as Test, and then hit enter. You will then be prompted You may enter the text of the message and you will be offered the line number 1&gt; where you can type your message, such as the infamous Hello world. Next will be line 2&gt; and if you are done, just hit enter and at EDIT Option: you can do the same. At Send mail to: POSTMASTER// enter the initials you used for your DUZ which were probably SM for System Manager. You will then be told when MailMan was last used, which is probably NEVER. Hit enter at And Send to: and you should receive the message Select Message option: Transmit now// at which you hit enter and will hopefully receive the message Sending [1] Sent. Type &quot;^&quot; to exit.</p>
<p>103.</p>
<p>Now see if you received it. Log on using &quot;D ^ZU&quot;. At the Systems Manager prompt, type &quot;MAIL&quot;. Then at the Select MailMan Menu Option: type &quot;NEW&quot; Messages and Responses. Read the mail.</p>
<p>pic 32 - Read Mail</p>
<p>Start and test the RPC Broker.</p>
<p>The RPC Broker is VistA's Client/Server software and is needed by VistA's GUI client.</p>
<p>104.</p>
<p>Now to see of the RPC BROKER will start. To start the broker, type &quot;D STRT^XWBTCP(port)&quot; at the VISTA prompt. The system status should now show the broker listener (XWBTCPL) running.</p>
<p>&gt;D STRT^XWBTCP(9210) Start TCP Listener... Checking if TCP Listener has started... TCP Listener started successfully. &gt;</p>
<p>Now run &quot;D ^%SS&quot; again. You should see something like the following with XWBPTCL running.</p>
<p>pic 33 - Broker</p>
<p>105.</p>
<p>If you have the RPCTEST.EXT on your workstation, you test your connection to the localhost. Download the file XWB1_1WS.EXE from <a href="ftp://ftp.va.gov/vista/Software/Packages/RPC" class="uri">ftp://ftp.va.gov/vista/Software/Packages/RPC</a> Broker - XWB/PROGRAMS/. (Note: The VA's ftp site is not compatible with Netscape's ftp. Either use Windows Explorer or FTP software). Double click on this file once you have downloaded it. Accept the defaults. It will install RPC Broker's Client software including RPCTEST.EXE. Then go to C:program filesvistabrokerrcptest.exe and double click on it or create a shortcut on your desktop.</p>
<p>pic 34 - RPC Test</p>
<p>106.</p>
<p>You should see a Vista logon screen.</p>
<p>pic 35 - Vista Logon</p>
<p>108.</p>
<p>If you connect successfully, the link state will turn green.</p>
<p>pic 36 - Broker Connect</p>
<p>109.</p>
<p>To stop TaskMan, use &quot;D STOP^ZTMKU&quot; and answer &quot;YES&quot; to stopping the submanagers.</p>
<p>110.</p>
<p>To stop Broker, use &quot;D STOP^XWBTCP(9210)&quot;. This is the last time you should be using these direct access to the routines to manage VistA. You should be using the menu system from now on to manage starting and stopping Taskman, the background filers and the RPC Broker. That way any code changes, etc., will be accounted for. Programmers will usually enter from the programmer prompt beginning with D ^XUP. The system managers menu option is EVE.</p>
