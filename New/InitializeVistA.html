<h2 id="getting-into-the-direct-mode-aka-programmer-mode">Getting into the Direct Mode (aka) Programmer Mode</h2>
<p>Before there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPLs</a>, Mumps always has had something called Direct Mode, which is a simplified REPL. It's also known as Programmer Mode. Normally, end users are not allowed to access Programmer Mode, as it is essentially like running as root on a Unix System.</p>
<p>To connect to VISTA and start configuring it, you need a terminal emulator. Make sure that your terminal emulator emulates VT-100, VT-220, VT-320 or VT-52. By default, most terminal emulators do that already. You specifically cannot use the rxvt terminal emulator though.</p>
<p>If you modified your $TERM, you need to make sure it's either <code>xterm</code> or <code>ansi</code>. Others generally will work, but I am sure of these two.</p>
<p>To get into Direct Mode using Cache, on Windows you need to right click on the Cache Cube and choose Terminal. If you have a licnesed version of Cache, you can also use Telnet to connect to the Terminal. Please note that while you can use Windows Telnet, it does not emulate VT-200 series terminals properly, so you may have some issues. If you want to use Telnet, I recommend downloading PuTTY or TeraTerm.</p>
<p>PuTTY: <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a>.</p>
<p>TeraTerm: <a href="https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en">https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en</a>.</p>
<p>If you use PuTTY, change the function key bindings so that they behave like VT-100+. See here: <a href="https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.58/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#config-funkeys">https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.58/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#config-funkeys</a>.</p>
<p>On a Mac, Terminal is a fully featured terminal emulator. You may wish to tell it via System Preferences that you want your function keys to send Function commands, rather than dimming your screen or muting your volume. Otherwise, you have to use FN all the time to override the function keys (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204436">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204436</a>).</p>
<p>On Linux, you can use any Terminal Emulator program, with the exception of rxvt. You can actually even use PuTTY on Linux. F1 may be bound to do help. You need to unmap that in the Terminal application. (<a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/37313/how-do-i-deactivate-f1-and-f10-keybindings-in-gnome-terminal">http://askubuntu.com/questions/37313/how-do-i-deactivate-f1-and-f10-keybindings-in-gnome-terminal</a>).</p>
<p>After you open your terminal emulator, do the following:</p>
<p>On Cache on Linux or Mac, you need to run <code>ccontrol list</code> to find your instance name, and then run <code>csession &lt;instance name&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>On GT.M, you need to source your environement file (if you followed this guide, it should be in /var/db/&lt;name&gt; as env.vista). To source, type <code>. /var/db/&lt;name&gt;/env.vista</code>. The dot is all by itself. Then type <code>mumps -dir</code> to go into direct mode.</p>
<p>You will see something like this:</p>
<div class="code"><code>GTM></code></div>
<p>or in Cache:</p>
<div class="code"><code>USER></code></div>
<p>If you are in Cache, you need to switch namespaces. (If you don't remember, type ? to see your choices.)</p>
<div class="code"><code>><strong>D ^%CD</strong>

NAMESPACE// <strong>VISTA</strong></code></div>
<h2 id="commands-and-what-they-mean-a-short-m-primer">Commands and what they mean (a short M primer)</h2>
<p>In the excerpts below, you will enter Mumps (M) commands into direct mode. Here are a few interesting ones:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode M"><code>S DUZ=.5 ; S is a shortcut for SET, DUZ means user number; .5 is a user that is always present on VistA systems.

D ^XUP ; D is a shortcut for DO, ^XUP is the name of the routine. ^XUP is the programmer mode menu runner.

; A semicolon, like in GAS assembly, is the comment character. M, like C, was written to replace assembly.

D Q^DI ; Do starting from Label Q in Routine DI. Q^DI is how to enter Fileman.</code></pre>
<h2 id="vista-text-mode-conventions">VistA Text Mode Conventions</h2>
<p>There are a few confusing conventions that outsiders don't understand right away. Here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>//</code> means that the preceding text is the default. If you press enter, you will accept it.</li>
<li><code>Replace</code> means that the existing text is long and you can edit it. Typing <code>...</code> means that you will replace the entire thing; <code>END</code> appends to the end. You can also use <code>...</code> to signify a range between two elements.</li>
<li><code>@</code> deletes an item.</li>
<li><code>^</code> usually lets you quit what you are in the middle of.</li>
<li><code>?</code> Short Help. Typically it tells you that you need to type a number or text.</li>
<li><code>??</code> More Help. Should tell you what the field you are filling does. In the menu system, show all menus with what security keys they need.</li>
<li><code>???</code> In the menu system, display help for each immediate submenu.</li>
<li><code>????</code> In the menu system, display help for current menu.</li>
<li><code>&lt;enter&gt;</code> key is the main navigation key in VistA. Typing it after an entry enters that entry; typing when nothing is entered will move you forward or up, depending on the context.</li>
<li><code>Select &lt;item&gt;</code> Whenever you see select, you can select or add an item; after that, you can edit it.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="begin-to-set-up-the-vista-system">Begin to Set Up the VistA System</h1>
<h2 id="device-configuration">Device Configuration</h2>
<p>The very first thing we want to do is to set-up 3 devices: NULL, CONSOLE, and VIRTUAL (known historically as TELNET due to what often accessed it). The NULL device corresponds to a place where we dump data we don't want; that's <code>/dev/null</code> on all Unices; <code>//./nul</code> on Windows. The NULL device is also known as the &quot;BIT BUCKET&quot;, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>CONSOLE stands for the device the terminal presents itself as if directly connected to a computer. These days, no computer has real console devices. Linux still has an emulated console device: <code>/dev/tty</code>. Cache Terminal presents a console device called <code>|TRM|</code>.</p>
<p>VIRTUAL stands for all connections from Virtual Emulators. Unfortunately every different operating system provides a different console device:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux: <code>/dev/pts</code> (Use with both Cache and GT.M)</li>
<li>macOS: <code>/dev/ttys</code> (ditto)</li>
<li>Cygwin: <code>/dev/cons</code> (GT.M)</li>
<li>Cache Telnet: <code>|TNT|</code> (Cache/Windows ONLY)</li>
</ul>
<p>The way set up devices is to edit the DEVICE file in Fileman. Fileman is the Database Management System for VistA; unlike most databases in the market, it provides a user interface as well, albiet a text-based one.</p>
<p>To get into Fileman, you need to set your user (DUZ) to .5, and then go in.</p>
<h3 id="null-device">NULL Device</h3>
<p>There should only be one device named &quot;NULL&quot;. Unfortunately, there are three NULLs of various flavors in the FOIA; we need to make sure there is only one. Follow the following. We rename the nulls we don't want, and we delete a synonym.</p>

<p>The four pieces of the string are:</p>
<p><code>UCI^VOL^NODE^VOLUME:BOX</code></p>
<p>The fourth piece, the VOLUME:BOX pair, is referred to as the &quot;BOX VOLUME pair&quot;. The first component of the Box Volume pair is the Volume Set, which is used to determine where the VistA system will be able to find the routines. The second component Box, which references the system that the instance is on. In a Caché system, it would be the name of the Caché instance while on GT.M, it should reference the hostname of the machine.</p>
<p>The Volume Set result needs to be altered in the <code>VOLUME SET</code> file, and we will reuse some setup by writing over the name of the first entry that is already in the VistA system. The first entry, the entry with an IEN of 1, can be selected by entering <code>`1</code>.</p>
<p>Then we rename the first Box-Volume pair in the <code>TaskMan Site Parameters</code> file to match what was found above.</p>
<p>For this demonstration instance, the Volume Set will be <code>VISTA</code> which is the Caché namespace that holds the files. On GT.M instances, the default value of <code>PLA</code> can be maintained.</p>

You can exit by typing &quot;^&quot; on the command line and the change you made will be saved. At a minimum, assign EVE as the PRIMARY MENU and enter IRM (it's the only choice) as SERVICE/SECTION.

<p>Press &lt;PF1&gt; refers to notations for use of Vista on Terminals. For example, the original VT-320 keyboard had additional character sets and keys which include Find, Select, Insert, Remove, Previous Screen, Next Screen, an arrow cluster and F1 to F20. With Caché, the Keys are &quot;mapped&quot;, which means when you push a given key it acts as the key would in a terminal. For instance, F1, F2, F3 and F4 are equivalent to the PF1, PF2, PF3 and PF4 keys on the terminal keyboard and Page Up and Page Down on the computer keyboard correspond to Previous Screen and Next Screen. A listing of other mappings can be found at the Caché Cube Terminal window under Help and search Keyboard Mappings. Also there is lots of information about terminal if you are interested at www.VT100.net.</p>

<p>These are basic devices to complete the setup. You can setup other devices, such as printers, later. The Platinum CACHE.DAT already comes with preconfigured devices. It is best to leave the VOLUME SET(CPU) field blank. The help text for the field states: &quot;If no name has been entered for this field, this device is assumed to be accessible from all CPUs in the network. In other words, when this device is referenced, the device handler will operate as if this device is resident on the local CPU&quot;. The SIGN-ON/SYSTEM DEVICE: field should be set to <code>NO</code> or left blank for output devices and <code>YES</code> if the device isused to log on to the system. Use FileMan to edit the CONSOLE, NULL, HFS, and TELNET devices. CONSOLE is the primary logon device. The NULL device is used by the Vista RPC Broker and HFS is used by the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) to install application patches and new applications when they are released. On the single user Caché PC you will not need the TELNET device since it does not allow remote access.</p>

Select DEVICE NAME: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong><code></div>
<p>Again from the VISTA promt, enter <code>D ^ZTMCHK</code> to check if TaskMan's environment is OK. This will present you with two screens with information on TaskMan's environment.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/InitializeVistA/pic28.gif" />
</figure>
<p>Screen #1</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/InitializeVistA/pic29.gif" />
</figure>
<p>Screen #2</p>
<p>If TaskMan's environment is OK, you are ready to start TaskMan. Go back to the VISTA prompt and type <code>D ^ZTMB</code> to start TASKMAN.</p>
<p>To monitor TaskMan, enter <code>D ^ZTMON</code> from the VISTA prompt. Enter <code>^</code> at the UPDATE// prompt to exit the monitor or enter a <code>?</code> to see what the other options are.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/InitializeVistA/pic30.gif" />
</figure>
<p>From the &gt; programmer prompt you can check the system status with <code>D ^%SS</code>. You should see at least two Taskman processes - %ZTM and %ZTMS.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/InitializeVistA/pic31.gif" />
</figure>
<p>Now send a message using Postmaster to your DUZ number. Use D ^%CD to get into the namespace, VISTA, and then type <code>S DUZ=.5 D ^XUP</code>. You will get the response SETTING UP PROGRAMMER ENVIROMENT then TERMINAL TYPE SET TO: (your default) and Select OPTION NAME:. You will need to respond: <code>XMUSER</code>. At Select Mailman Menu Option: type <code>S</code> (for send). At Subject: enter your subject, such as Test, and then hit enter. You will then be prompted You may enter the text of the message and you will be offered the line number 1&gt; where you can type your message, such as the infamous Hello world. Next will be line 2&gt; and if you are done, just hit enter and at EDIT Option: you can do the same. At Send mail to: POSTMASTER// enter the initials you used for your DUZ which were probably SM for System Manager. You will then be told when MailMan was last used, which is probably NEVER. Hit enter at And Send to: and you should receive the message Select Message option: Transmit now// at which you hit enter and will hopefully receive the message Sending [1] Sent. Type <code>^</code> to exit.</p>
<p>Now see if you received it. Log on using <code>D ^ZU</code>. At the Systems Manager prompt, type <code>MAIL</code>. Then at the Select MailMan Menu Option: type <code>NEW</code> Messages and Responses. Read the mail.</p>

<p>Start and test the RPC Broker.</p>
<p>The RPC Broker is VistA's Client/Server software and is needed by VistA's GUI client.</p>
<p>Now to see of the RPC BROKER will start. To start the broker, type <code>D STRT^XWBTCP(port)</code> at the VISTA prompt. The system status should now show the broker listener (XWBTCPL) running.</p>
<div class="code"><code>><strong>D STRT^XWBTCP(9210)</strong>
Start TCP Listener...
Checking if TCP Listener has started...
TCP Listener started successfully.
></code></div>
<p>Now run <code>D ^%SS</code> again. You should see something like the following with XWBPTCL running.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/InitializeVistA/pic33.gif" />
</figure>
<p>If you have the RPCTEST.EXT on your workstation, you test your connection to the localhost. Download the file XWB1_1WS.EXE from <a href="ftp://ftp.va.gov/vista/Software/Packages/RPC%20Broker%20-%20XWB/PROGRAMS/">ftp://ftp.va.gov/vista/Software/Packages/RPC%20Broker%20-%20XWB/PROGRAMS/</a>. (Note: The VA's ftp site is not compatible with Netscape's ftp. Either use Windows Explorer or FTP software). Double click on this file once you have downloaded it. Accept the defaults. It will install RPC Broker's Client software including RPCTEST.EXE. Then go to C:program filesvistabrokerrcptest.exe and double click on it or create a shortcut on your desktop.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/InitializeVistA/pic34.gif" />
</figure>
<p>You should see a Vista logon screen.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/InitializeVistA/pic35.gif" />
</figure>
<p>If you connect successfully, the link state will turn green.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/InitializeVistA/pic36.gif" />
</figure>
<p>To stop TaskMan, use <code>D STOP^ZTMKU</code> and answer <code>YES</code> to stopping the submanagers.</p>
<p>To stop Broker, use <code>D STOP^XWBTCP(9210)</code>. This is the last time you should be using these direct access to the routines to manage VistA. You should be using the menu system from now on to manage starting and stopping Taskman, the background filers and the RPC Broker. That way any code changes, etc., will be accounted for. Programmers will usually enter from the programmer prompt beginning with D ^XUP. The system managers menu option is EVE.</p>
<h2 id="add-user">Add User</h2>
<p>The next step is to create a user that can sign on to the CPRS GUI. The things to make sure that this new user has are</p>
<ul>
<li>A Secondary menu option of &quot;OR CPRS GUI CHART&quot;</li>
<li>CPRS Tab Access</li>
<li>An ACCESS CODE</li>
<li>A VERIFY CODE</li>
<li>Service/Section (required for any user)</li>
</ul>
<p>The menu option ensures that the user has the proper permissions to access CPRS after signing in with their ACCESS and VERIFY codes. The Tab access can limit the amount of things a user can access once they have signed in.</p>
<p>The adding of the user is done through the User Management menu in the menu system, which will ask for information in a series of prompts then will open a Screenman form to complete the task.</p>
<p>The following steps will add a generic <code>CPRS,USER</code> person who will be able to sign into CPRS.</p>
